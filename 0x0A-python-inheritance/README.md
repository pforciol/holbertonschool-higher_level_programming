# 0x0A - Python - Inheritance

At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* Why Python programming is awesome
* What is a superclass, baseclass or parentclass
* What is a subclass
* How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
* When can an instance have new attributes
* How to inherit class from another
* How to define a class with multiple base classes
* What is the default class every class inherit from
* How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
* Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
* What is the purpose of inheritance
* What are, when and how to use `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `type` and `super` built-in functions
