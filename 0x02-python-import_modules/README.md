# 0x02 - Python - import & modules

At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* Why Python programming is awesome
* How to import functions from another file
* How to use imported functions
* How to create a module
* How to use the built-in function `dir()`
* How to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported
* How to use command line arguments with your Python programs
