* Who created Python
* Who is Guido van Rossum
* Where does the name ‘Python’ come from
* What is the Zen of Python
* How to use the Python interpreter
* How to print text and variables using `print`
* How to use strings
* What are indexing and slicing in Python
* What is the official Holberton Python coding style and how to check your code with `PEP 8`
