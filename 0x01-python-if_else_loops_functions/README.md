* How to use the 'while' and 'for' loops
* How is Python’s 'for' different from 'C'‘s?
* How to use the 'break' and 'continues' statements
* How to use 'else' clauses on loops
* What does the 'pass' statement do, and when to use it
* How to use 'range'
* What is a function and how do you use functions
